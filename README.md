Im currently studying for my BSc (HONS) Game Programming and Design course at SAE Institute of Athens, Greece.

Currently working at MaslasBros ( https://maslasbros.com/ ) as Junior Games Programmer to contribute to the development of Modern Naval Warfare

As far back as I can remember, I was always obsessed with consoles and computers because I played those classic video games that gave many children moments of freedom and joy.
From an early age, I loved the idea of programming and the opportunity it gave people to cultivate their logic and artistic nature.
So, I decided to combine my two great passions in life and give others these peaceful moments of freedom, joy, and the chance to develop a better character.
